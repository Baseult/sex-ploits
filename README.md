Known & working exploits to me. <br>
<br>
((Shop exploit)) - lets you connect to any players shop with just his nickname. <br>
Multiple games at once - lets you play up to 3 games at the same time. Wining grants you triple exp, triple ip, and AFK ban. <br>
Spectator Mode [Semi Fog of war] - Lets you watch the game without delay. <br>
Dev Mode - Lets you play tutorials with friends - 5v5 (player 1, left team top player, will be forced to be ashe/garen/ryze, but will have stat boosts +20 to all stats, opposite team gets all stats reduced). <br>
Lobby - Let's you play any gamemode in any map/q <br>
Practice Tool - You can play 11 vs 11 [more players in any team = infinite champion select] (no, you can't play with players it will say that too many humans, and when u kick urself it will say that at least 1 player is needed). <br>
Cross Gifting - You can gift to anyone in any server as long as it is [Riot server] ex. NA can gift to EUNE player without 24h delay as long as he has correct amount of RP. <br>
Connect as 6th player - you won't be able to move, you will be able to see BOTH teammates vision. Players can't see you, you can't chat - YOU CAN BUY ITEMS!!!!!! You won't get any rewards but the purpose of this is different right? :) <br>
Bots - You can set those 5 difficulties: Null (spawn standing afk) Intro (moves after 15 mins) Easy / medium / DOOM (no passives just very good AI)<br>
Any skin in custom - You can use ANY SKIN ex KING KOOPA RAMUMUS which was avaiable only for BETA TESTERS of LEAGUE (AVAIABLE ONLY FOR CHAMPIONS THAT ARE SELECTABLE AS BOTS)<br>
Editing your stats & ranked stats - visualy client only, other players see it, changes nothing, but you can troll saying you are Riot Mirage <br>.
Chat Restriction - you can't /all chat but you still can change RestrictedChatInitialMsgs = 3; RestrictedChatMaximumMsgs = 5; RestrictedChatAddMsgTimeInSeconds = 240; so who cares? <br>
No Leave Buster - delete rcp-be-lol-leaver-buster from lobby and matchmaking.<br>

Custom Game - lets you be 2nd owner of custom game - you can kick / add bots, you cannot be kicked.<br>
Pick while locked - Lets you change your champion when you already locked - doesnt work with baning game mode so only blind pick <br>
See enemies at ARAM - still working.<br>
