List of all Exploits I am/have been using to show that Riot can't code shit. <br>
<br>
**Shop exploit** - lets you connect to any players shop with just his nickname. <br>
**Multiple games at once** - lets you play up to 3 games at the same time. Wining grants you triple exp, triple ip, and AFK ban. <br>
**Spectator Mode [Semi Fog of war]** - Lets you watch the game without delay. <br>
**Dev Mode** - Lets you play tutorials with friends - 5v5 (player 1, left team top player, will be forced to be ashe/garen/ryze, but will have stat boosts +20 to all stats, opposite team gets all stats reduced). <br>
**Lobby** - Let's you play any gamemode in any map/q <br>
**Old Ash Q** - Playing as Ashe, adds her Q passive to other players/turrets changing their skills ex. azir auto attacks becoming his passive (places turrets everywhere on the map)<br>
**Practice Tool** - You can play 11 vs 11 [more players in any team = infinite champion select] (no, you can't play with players it will say that too many humans, and when u kick urself it will say that at least 1 player is needed). <br>
**Cross Gifting** - You can gift to anyone in any server as long as it is [Riot server] ex. NA can gift to EUNE player without 24h delay as long as he has correct amount of RP. <br>
**Connect as 6th player** - you won't be able to move, you will be able to see BOTH teammates vision. Players can't see you, you can't chat - YOU CAN BUY ITEMS!!!!!! You won't get any rewards but the purpose of this is different right? :) <br>
**Bots** - You can set those 5 difficulties: Null (spawn standing afk) Intro (moves after 15 mins) Easy / medium / DOOM (no passives just very good AI)<br>
**Any skin in custom** - You can use ANY SKIN ex KING KOOPA RAMUMUS which was avaiable only for BETA TESTERS of LEAGUE (AVAIABLE ONLY FOR CHAMPIONS THAT ARE SELECTABLE AS BOTS)<br>
**Editing your stats & ranked stats** - visualy client only, other players see it, changes nothing, but you can troll saying you are Riot Mirage.<br>
**Chat Restriction** - you can't /all chat but you still can change RestrictedChatInitialMsgs = 3; RestrictedChatMaximumMsgs = 5; RestrictedChatAddMsgTimeInSeconds = 240; so who cares?<br>
**No Leave Buster** - delete rcp-be-lol-leaver-buster from lobby and matchmaking.<br>
**Kick players from club** - Kicks players from club u do not own, you can even kick officers, you cannot kick creator. <br>
**Custom Game** - lets you be 2nd owner of custom game - you can kick / add bots, you cannot be kicked.<br>
**Pick while locked** - Lets you change your champion when you already locked - doesnt work with baning game mode so only blind pick<br>
**See enemies at ARAM** - still working.<br>
**Team Boost** - if ur account has 150? (not sure) rp - you can activate TEAM BOOST - all ur players get random skin unlocked + if u win bonus ip (any Q) <br>
**Role protection** - basicaly you get protection from getting auto filled so you can play ur role. <br>
**Refund Exploit** - places 1 consumable items in a ward slot - lets you use that forever (infinite potions, doesnt work for cleptomancy gold consumables (u cant use them) works for +1 stat point potion thou (if lucky u can be lvl 18 with lvl 3 champion)<br>
**ARAM EXPLOIT** - boosts arams to gain 200 / 100 Blue Essence / Random Skin & little extra experience boost without eating your RP.<br>
**Summoner's Rift Global Spells** - Makes your spells global, meaning for ex. Poppy can hit all enemy champions even in fountain.<br>
**Clash Exploit** - Let's you play CLASH LOBBY anytime as 5vs5 custom (need 10 players yes) - to farm free emotes & skin shards per game.<br>
**Surrender Exploit** - You start surrender vote for your team, but you win game if all 5 players vote yes (forces enemy nexus to boom) [DJ SONA / Spirit guard udyr / Yone only]<br>
