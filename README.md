List of all Exploits I am/have been using to show that Riot can't code shit. <br>
<br>

<h1>**Working**</h1><br>


**Shop exploit** - lets you connect to any players shop with just his nickname. <br>
**Multiple games at once** - lets you play up to 3 games at the same time. Wining grants you triple exp, triple ip, and AFK ban. <br>
**Spectator Mode [Semi Fog of war]** - Lets you watch the game without delay. <br>
**Dev Mode** - Lets you play tutorials with friends - 5v5 (player 1, left team top player, will be forced to be ashe/garen/ryze, but will have stat boosts +20 to all stats, opposite team gets all stats reduced)<br>
**Lobby / Custom Gamemode** - Let's you play any gamemode in any map/q IF its present in files (ex butchers bridge is up 27.08.2020) or with any working gamemutator (passives: urf, doombots etc)<br>
**Practice Tool** - You can play 11 vs 11 [more players in any team = infinite champion select] (no, you can't play with players it will say that too many humans, and when u kick urself it will say that at least 1 player is needed). <br>
**Cross Gifting** - You can gift to anyone in any server as long as it is [Riot server] ex. NA can gift to EUNE player without 24h delay as long as he has correct amount of RP<br>
**Bots** - You can set those 5 difficulties: Null (spawn standing afk) Intro (moves after 15 mins) Easy / medium / DOOM<br>
**Any skin in custom** - You can use ANY SKIN ex KING KOOPA RAMUMUS which was avaiable only for BETA TESTERS of LEAGUE (AVAIABLE ONLY FOR CHAMPIONS THAT ARE SELECTABLE AS BOTS)<br>
**Editing your stats & ranked stats** - visualy client only, other players see it, changes nothing, but you can troll saying you are Riot Mirage.<br>
**Chat Restriction** - you can't /all chat but you still can change RestrictedChatInitialMsgs = 3; RestrictedChatMaximumMsgs = 5; RestrictedChatAddMsgTimeInSeconds = 240; so who cares?<br>
**Pick while locked** - Lets you change your champion when you already locked - doesnt work with baning game mode so only blind pick<br>
**See enemies at ARAM** - c`mun riot /v3 and you still didnt fix this shit?<br>
**Team Boost** - if ur account has 150? (not sure) rp - you can activate TEAM BOOST - all ur players get random skin unlocked + if u win bonus ip (any Q) <br>
**Role protection** - basicaly you get protection from getting auto filled so you can play ur role<br>
**ARAM EXPLOIT** - Download at our discord | Boosts aram 200BE + 1 random skin for a game without RP<br>
**Clash Exploit** - Let's you play CLASH LOBBY anytime as 5vs5 custom (need 10 players yes) - to farm free emotes & skin shards per game.<br>
**Surrender Exploit** - You start surrender vote for your team, but you win game if all 5 players vote yes (forces enemy nexus to boom) [DJ SONA / Spirit guard udyr / Yone only]<br>
**Crash Client Exploit** - [Requires 125rp? not sure.] Basicaly you spam failed gift requests to target, since its HTTP POST thread, it stacks when he is in game. Meaning you will crash his client if you spam too many, resulting in bugsplat (game closes) All you need to do is have him in your friendlist.<br>
**Name Exploit** - Hard to explain, basicaly you don't name yourself, if u bot accounts, you can just use this method to get lvl 30 then sell it so client can namechange for free: https://tr.op.gg/summoner/userName=d201daec-9524-4864-98af-1296b7b2912b Still works - 21.12.2020<br>
**Missions/Pass Exploit** - Bored to farm tokens? no problem! spam TFT Tutorial lobby, it counts towards total games. you can surrender in 2-1 so basicaly 4 minutes games = all missions done<br>
**Ranked Exploit** - Ye this shit works again XD you just need ***** censored on request. Lets you play rankeds with your friends (5vs5 custom) and you gain/loose LP XDDD well played riot  - tested on 21.12.2020 || Selling this 200â‚¬ dm on dc.<br>
**Crash Anyone** - Make someone suffer - disable his client, won't be able to play shit as long as you want.<br>


<h2>**Patched**</h2><br>



**Old Ash Q** - Playing as Ashe, adds her Q passive to other players/turrets changing their skills ex. azir auto attacks becoming his passive (places turrets everywhere on the map)<br>
**Connect as 6th player** - you won't be able to move, you will be able to see BOTH teammates vision. Players can't see you, you can't chat - YOU CAN BUY ITEMS!!!!!! You won't get any rewards but the purpose of this is different right? :) <br>
